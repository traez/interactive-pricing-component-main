## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1) Continued use of Objects to hold data. Nothing much else too new.  
2) Exposure to new concepts in CSS (slider and toggle). To save time and avoid diving into deep CSS I decided against designing Input Range Track and Thumb ("The slider", as a different styling would be needed for each browser: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft, etc).  

### Continued development

Need to attempt challenges with much tougher JavaScript and avoid getting swamped by CSS.  

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow, MDN Web Docs, w3schools, YouTube, Google
